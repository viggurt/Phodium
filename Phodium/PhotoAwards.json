              "description": "Survivors carry religious images, ten days after Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the central Philippines. One of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, Haiyan raged through 47 provinces, causing immense destruction. Over a million houses were damaged, half of them totally destroyed, and more than 4 million people were displaced. Large areas were left without electricity or an adequate water supply for weeks, and the devastation of infrastructure made food distribution and medical services difficult. Many people made their way to less-affected areas, such as the capital Manila, and some cities reported a near doubling of their populations.",

The school served as a reception center, providing temporary accommodation for newly arrived refugees. The number of asylum-seekers crossing the border from Turkey into Bulgaria rose sharply during 2013, to around 8,000. Most came from Syria or Afghanistan. Bulgaria, one of the poorest countries in the European Union, struggled to cope with the influx. The reception center had no heating or hot water, and the government could offer those living there no food or healthcare. Countries worldwide offered only 18,000 places to the nearly 2.4 million Syrian refugees.",

A traditional economy based on small-scale, sustainable whaling, and fishing from family-owned boats, is no longer viable. Whalingâ€”which the islanders practice legally under an international dispensation, as an historically and culturally important industryâ€”is a physically demanding and at times dangerous occupation. Costs are high and financial returns low, as there is no export demand for whale meat, and many Norwegians consider it Depression-era or eco-unfriendly food. Other fishing activity is being taken over by larger companies using trawlers, rather than small, family-owned boats. The younger generation is opting for safer, salaried work, away from the islands, often in the oil industry or tourism.",

Very few support organizations exist for gay people in the DRC. The country has no explicit law against homosexuality; nevertheless there is very little social acceptance of same-sex relationships.\n\nLGBT people are increasingly subject to discrimination and violence, and many keep their identities hidden in order to avoid assault and stigmatization. In December, a draft bill criminalizing gay sex was proposed in the DRC parliament. Supporters of the bill claim that same-sex activity is un-African, and a result of Western influence. Opponents say that such relationships existed in traditional culture, and point to harsh colonial-era laws as a source of negative attitudes.",
